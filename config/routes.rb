  When the web browser makes a request, a router component will check the config/routes.rb 
  file and determine which controller should handle the request, based on the web address 
  and HTTP protocol. The controller will obtain any needed data from a model. After obtaining 
  data, the controller will render a response combining data from the model with a view 
  component that provides markup and layout. The response is an HTML file that the controller 
  assembles for the browser to display.

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
